A PERN stack booking system that allows users to register, log in, view available time slots, and manage their bookings.

## Technologies Used

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,bootstrap,express,nodejs,postgres,firebase)](https://skillicons.dev)

## What I'm Most Proud Of:
1. Built a full-stack booking system using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js).
2. Implemented user authentication and protected routes using Firebase Authentication.
3. Displayed real-time available and booked times
4. Added Toastify notification to give instant feedback when a booking is added successfully.

## Challenges Encountered:
Filtering past bookings and upcoming ones was tricky at first, but I solved it using date comparisons with moment.js.
